    "**Assumptions :**  \n",
    "This model is based on the following assumptions:   \n",
    "\n",
    "-No arbitrage opportunities (no way to make a profit without risk)   \n",
    "-The price of the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion   \n",
    "-No transaction costs    \n",
    "-Risk-free interest rate, known in advance and constant  \n",
    "-Volatility of the share price known in advance and constant   \n",
    "-The underlying asset is a continuous and perfectly divisible (for example, one can buy 1/100th of a share)    \n",
    "-The underlying asset does not pay dividends    \n",
    "-The option is European, it can only be exercised at expiration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criticisms :**  \n",
    "These assumptions are not necessarily true in the real world, and the model may not always accurately reflect the true price of an option. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the model assumes that dividends, volatility and risk-free rates remain constant over the life of the option, which does not reflect the actual market. In practice, volatility depends on the strike price and the maturity.  \n",
    "In addition, not taking into account taxes and commissions can also lead to valuations that deviate from the actual results. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is a useful tool for approximating the fair price of an option and for understanding the factors that affect the price of an option."
